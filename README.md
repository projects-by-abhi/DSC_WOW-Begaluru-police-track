# DSC_WOW-Begaluru-police-track
a repository for the dsc wow hackathon

the project will crawl for onion links and also visit them. 

A bot will search for illegal fileds and cause a red alert.(partially dealt with the word scanner that will scan for keyword)
Still needs to be more automated though

future scope :- Integrating Ai to check if the links is indeed malicious and might contain illegal trasaction, to give more precise result.
